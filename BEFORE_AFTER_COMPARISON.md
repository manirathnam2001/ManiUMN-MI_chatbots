## What Changed in Code

### Function Signature Changes

**Before:**
```python
MIScorer.get_score_breakdown(feedback_text, debug=False)
```

**After (Backwards Compatible):**
```python
# Old way still works
MIScorer.get_score_breakdown(feedback_text, debug=False)

# New way with internal tracking
MIScorer.get_score_breakdown(
    feedback_text, 
    debug=False,
    enable_internal_adjustments=True,  # NEW
    attempt_number=1                    # NEW
)
```

### Return Value Changes

**Before:**
```python
{
    'components': {...},
    'total_score': 15.0,
    'total_possible': 30.0,
    'percentage': 50.0
}
```

**After (with tracking enabled):**
```python
{
    'components': {...},
    'total_score': 17.0,  # Adjusted score
    'total_possible': 30.0,
    'percentage': 56.7,
    '_internal_tracking': {  # NEW (hidden with _ prefix)
        'base_score': 15.0,
        'effort_bonus': 2.0,
        'time_factor': 1.0,
        'attempt_number': 1,
        'enabled': True
    }
}
```
