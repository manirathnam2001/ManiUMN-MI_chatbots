# Git-Based Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of git-based logging with daily log files and UTC timestamps for the MI Chatbots Box integration system.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Log Directory Change
- **Before:** `logs/`
- **After:** `git_logs/`
- All logging components now use the new `git_logs/` directory by default

### 2. Log Filename Format
- **Before:** `box_uploads_{bot_type}.log` (e.g., `box_uploads_ohi.log`)
- **After:** `box_uploads_{bot_type}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.log` (e.g., `box_uploads_ohi_2025-10-07.log`)
- Log files now include UTC date in the filename
- Daily log files are automatically created based on UTC date

### 3. Log Rotation Strategy
- **Before:** RotatingFileHandler with size-based rotation (10MB, 5 backups)
- **After:** Daily log files with date-based naming
- Old log files are deleted entirely after the cleanup period (90 days default)
- Simpler and more git-friendly approach

### 4. Git Integration
Created `.gitignore` rules for proper log file management:
```gitignore
# Keep git_logs directory
!git_logs/
!git_logs/*.log

# Ignore rotated log files
git_logs/*.log.*
```

This ensures:
- The `git_logs/` directory is tracked
- Daily `.log` files are tracked
- Rotated files (`.log.1`, `.log.2`, etc.) are ignored

## Modified Files

### Core Files
1. **upload_logs.py**
   - Changed default `log_directory` from `"logs"` to `"git_logs"` in:
     - `BoxUploadLogger.__init__()`
     - `LogAnalyzer.__init__()`
     - `BoxUploadMonitor.__init__()`
   - Added `_get_log_filename()` method to generate daily log filenames
   - Modified `_setup_logger()` to use `FileHandler` instead of `RotatingFileHandler`
   - Updated `LogAnalyzer._read_log_file()` to read all daily log files
   - Fixed `cleanup_old_logs()` to delete entire old daily log files

2. **test_box_integration.py**
   - Updated tests to use `logger._get_log_filename()` for dynamic filename
   - Modified assertions to check for daily log files

### Configuration Files
3. **config.json**
   - Updated `logging.log_directory` from `"logs"` to `"git_logs"`
   - Updated `logging.log_file` path to `"git_logs/box_uploads.log"`

4. **.gitignore**
   - Added rules to track `git_logs/` directory
   - Added rules to track `.log` files
   - Added rules to ignore `.log.*` (rotated) files

### Documentation Files
5. **BOX_INTEGRATION.md**
   - Updated log file paths and descriptions
   - Changed rotation strategy documentation

6. **IMPLEMENTATION_BOX_INTEGRATION.md**
   - Updated log file path references

## Directory Structure

```
git_logs/
├── .gitkeep
├── box_uploads_ohi_2025-10-07.log
└── box_uploads_hpv_2025-10-07.log
```

## Log Entry Format

Each log entry is JSON formatted with UTC timestamp:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-10-07 20:27:29",
    "bot_type": "OHI",
    "level": "INFO",
    "event_type": "upload_attempt",
    "message": "Attempting to upload feedback_report.pdf for John Doe",
    "metadata": {
        "student_name": "John Doe",
        "filename": "feedback_report.pdf",
        "box_email": "OHI_dir.zcdwwmukjr9ab546@u.box.com",
        "file_size_bytes": 52000
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Logger
```python
from upload_logs import BoxUploadLogger

# Uses git_logs directory by default
logger = BoxUploadLogger("OHI")

# Or specify custom directory
logger = BoxUploadLogger("OHI", log_directory="./custom_logs")
```

### Reading Logs
```python
from upload_logs import LogAnalyzer

analyzer = LogAnalyzer()  # Uses git_logs by default
entries = analyzer._read_log_file('OHI')  # Reads all daily logs
stats = analyzer.get_upload_statistics('OHI')
```

### Cleanup Old Logs
```python
from upload_logs import LogAnalyzer

analyzer = LogAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.cleanup_old_logs(days=90)  # Deletes files older than 90 days
print(f"Deleted {results['OHI']} old OHI log files")
print(f"Deleted {results['HPV']} old HPV log files")
```

## Benefits

1. **Git-Friendly:** Daily log files are easier to track in git
2. **Simpler Management:** No complex rotation logic
3. **Clear History:** Each day has its own log file
4. **Easy Cleanup:** Old files are simply deleted
5. **UTC Timestamps:** Consistent timezone handling
6. **Better Organization:** Date-based filenames are self-documenting

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ BoxUploadLogger
- ✅ LogAnalyzer
- ✅ BoxUploadMonitor
- ✅ BoxUploader initialization
- ✅ BoxUploader PDF validation
- ✅ Log cleanup

## Migration Notes

If you have existing logs in the old `logs/` directory:

1. The old logs will continue to work but won't be tracked in git
2. New logs will be created in `git_logs/` with daily filenames
3. Consider archiving old logs before switching
4. The system will automatically use the new format going forward

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Automatic log compression for old files
2. Log aggregation for reporting
3. Integration with log analysis tools
4. Export to external logging services
5. Automated email alerts for critical errors
