# Error Handling Implementation - Code Comparison

## Before (Would Crash)

```python
# Navigate internally to the appropriate bot page
bot_type = result['bot']
if bot_type == "OHI":
    st.switch_page("pages/OHI.py")  # ❌ Could crash with StreamlitAPIException
elif bot_type == "HPV":
    st.switch_page("pages/HPV.py")  # ❌ Could crash with StreamlitAPIException
```

**Problem**: If the page file is missing or misconfigured, the app crashes with:
```
StreamlitAPIException: Could not find page: `pages/OHI.py`
```

---

## After (Graceful Error Handling)

```python
# Navigate internally to the appropriate bot page
bot_type = result['bot']
try:
    if bot_type == "OHI":
        st.switch_page("pages/OHI.py")  # ✅ Protected
    elif bot_type == "HPV":
        st.switch_page("pages/HPV.py")  # ✅ Protected
except StreamlitAPIException as e:
    st.error(
        f"⚠️ Navigation Error: Could not find the {bot_type} chatbot page. "
        f"This may indicate a deployment issue. Please contact support."
    )
    st.info(
        f"**Technical Details**: The page file `pages/{bot_type}.py` is missing or misconfigured. "
        "This should be resolved by the system administrator."
    )
```

**Solution**: If the page file is missing, users see a friendly error message instead of a crash.

---

## Import Added

```python
from streamlit.errors import StreamlitAPIException
```

---

## Error Message Output

When a page is missing, users see:

```
⚠️ Navigation Error: Could not find the OHI chatbot page. 
This may indicate a deployment issue. Please contact support.

ℹ️ Technical Details: The page file `pages/OHI.py` is missing or misconfigured.
This should be resolved by the system administrator.
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No Crashes**: App continues to function even if pages are missing
2. ✅ **User-Friendly**: Clear, actionable error messages for students
3. ✅ **Debuggable**: Technical details help administrators diagnose issues
4. ✅ **Production-Ready**: Graceful degradation for deployment issues
5. ✅ **Comprehensive**: Both navigation points are protected

---

## Test Coverage

Two try/except blocks protect navigation at:
1. **Line 489-502**: After successful code validation
2. **Line 516-529**: For already authenticated users

Both blocks provide identical error handling to ensure consistent user experience.
