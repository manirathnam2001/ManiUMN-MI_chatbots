**1. COLLABORATION (7.5 pts): Met** - The student demonstrated excellent partnership building throughout the conversation. They consistently used collaborative language and engaged the patient as an active participant in the discussion. This is a very long feedback text that should wrap properly in the table cell without being truncated to 80 characters.

**2. EVOCATION (7.5 pts): Partially Met** - The student showed some ability to draw out patient motivations but could improve by asking more open-ended questions. Another long feedback text to test wrapping.

**3. ACCEPTANCE (7.5 pts): Met** - Strong use of reflective listening and respect for patient autonomy.

**4. COMPASSION (7.5 pts): Met** - Demonstrated warmth and a non-judgmental approach.

**1. COLLABORATION (7.5 pts): Met** - Excellent partnership building throughout the conversation. The student consistently used collaborative language and engaged the patient as an active participant. They demonstrated strong rapport-building skills and made the patient feel like an equal partner in the decision-making process.

**2. EVOCATION (7.5 pts): Partially Met** - The student showed some ability to draw out patient motivations and concerns. However, they could improve by asking more **open-ended questions** and using **reflective listening** more consistently to explore the patient's perspective.

**3. ACCEPTANCE (7.5 pts): Met** - Strong demonstration of respect for patient autonomy. The student used affirmations effectively and reflected the patient's statements accurately. They avoided judgment and supported the patient's right to make their own decisions.

**4. COMPASSION (7.5 pts): Met** - Demonstrated warmth, empathy, and a non-judgmental approach throughout. The student created a safe environment for the patient to express concerns.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Practice using **reflective listening** more frequently
- Ask more **open-ended questions** to explore motivations
- **Affirm** patient strengths and positive statements
